             <div class="text">We hope you can join and participate in our Vibez Go Crazy Tournament on Friday July 15th, 2022. This is our 1-year anniversary tournament, and we are excited to be back in Madison, WI. With one year under our belt, we are excited about the impact we have made thus far in growing the game. Partnering with the newly renovated Glen Golf Park in Madison, we can’t wait to get out there and compete with our friends, family, and supporters! We hope to see you there.

            <div class="motto-text">We are an amateur golf club who want to truly expand the game of golf by paving the way for new demographics and individuals. To do so we plan to knock down many of the assumptions and misconceptions built around the sport that are deeply rooted with its elitist history. Golf should and can be played by anyone, regardless of their background, upbringing and personal appearances. No one should try to be someone they aren’t nor should they act a certain way to be accepted into the world of Golf. As long as you play the game for enjoyment and respect it’s rules, you can play. We want to build the bridge that allows someone who looks like us to just as easily pick up a golf club as they do a basketball or football.</div>
