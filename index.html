            <div class="motto-text">We are an amateur golf club who want to truly expand the game of golf by paving the way for new demographics and individuals. To do so we plan to knock down many of the assumptions and misconceptions built around the sport that are deeply rooted with its elitist history. Golf should and can be played by anyone, regardless of their background, upbringing and personal appearances. No one should try to be someone they aren’t nor should they act a certain way to be accepted into the world of Golf. As long as you play the game for enjoyment and respect it’s rules, you can play. We want to build the bridge that allows someone who looks like us to just as easily pick up a golf club as they do a basketball or football.</div>
